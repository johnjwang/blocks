Setting up the CCS Workspace
---------------------------
Launch CCS
Set your ccs workspace to be the workspace in this git repo (not required)
Open ccs and setup path requirements:
	Window->Preferences->General->Workspace->Linked Resources
	Click new and in the "name" section enter 'TIVAWARE' (without quotes) and click folder. Navigate to the installation location of tivaware on your system." Click "Ok"
	Click new again and then in the "name" section enter 'BLOCKS_HOME' (without quotes) and click folder. Navigate to this directory and click Ok.
    Click Ok again to exit preferences.

Compile driverlib and usblib
    Right click on driverlib in the Project Explorer and select 'Properties'
    Click on 'General' and select the chip that you are building for. Ie, TM4C1232C3PM
    Then switch configurations in the same menu pane to 'Release' and select the correct chip
    Do the same for usblib 
    Note: A hotkey for properties is to click on the project and press alt+enter
    Now that the libraries are configured, click on the driverlib and then click on the hammer icon in the top tray to build.
    Do the same for usblib

Import blocks projects
	Click "Import Project" and click "Browse..."
	Navigate to BLOCKS_HOME and click ok
	Again, make sure that you DO NOT have the "Copy projects into workspace" checked.
    Click Select All
    Click Finish
    Press ctrl+b to build your workspace

Fix ccs util for building binary files (Linux only)
    Navigate to your ccs installation directory. Ie, ~/ti/ccsv6
    Open the file utils/tiobj2bin and change the first line from 
        #!/bin/sh
        to
        #!/bin/bash

Download UniFlash to be able to flash Tiva from command line
    wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36951037/UNIFLASH2.2.0.00016_linux.tar.gz
    extract the tar.gz with 'tar -xvaf uniflash.tar.gz'
    run the uniflash_setup script without sudo permission
    install into your ti installation directory
    Once completed navigate to the uniflash installation directory. Ie ~/ti/uniflashv2
    Run the following command $sudo ./install_scripts/install_drivers.sh






-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manually adding driverlib and usblib

Import driverlib and usblib in ccs:
    Click'Import Project'
    Click 'Browse' and browse to $TIVAWARE/driverlib and click Ok
    Click 'Select All'
    Make sure 'Copy projects into workspace' is NOT selected
    Click Ok
    Do the same for usblib

    IMPORTANT: we had to compile our own version of driverlib
    to get the SysCtlClockGet to function properly, a bug for our
    chip prevents the clock frequency from ever being reported as
    higher than 66.6MHz (a clock divisor of 3). To fix this, do:
    
    in file: driverlib/sysctl.c
    
        comment out lines 2939 - 2942
        //if(ui32Max < ui32Clk)
        //{
        //	ui32Clk = ui32Max;
        //}
    
    Then, make sure that you clean and recompile all dependencies.

Todo list:
x watchdog the signals
- watchdog the device itself
- make bootload faster
	- add another bit to EEPROM that is "ignore bootload"
	  use when rebooting because of watchdogs
x kill listener
x hardcode a manual/autonomous switch line
- board side comms
- linux side comms
- linux side kill program
- write another program that uploads a serial number to eeprom
- touch base with Ella, remind her that she needs USB hubs
- test flight
- detect if an xbee is plugged in above it
- comms pass through from uart to usb
