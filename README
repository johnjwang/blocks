In order to import these projects into CCS do the following:

Set your ccs workspace to be the workspace in this git repo (not required)
Open ccs and setup path requirements:
	Window->Preferences->General->Workspace->Linked Resources
	Click new and in the "name" section enter 'TIVAWARE' (without quotes) and click folder. Navigate to the installation location of tivaware on your system." Click "Ok"
	Click new again and then in the "name" section enter 'BLOCKS_HOME' (without quotes) and click folder. Navigate to this directory and click Ok.

Import a new project in ccs:
	Click "Import Project" and click "Browse..."
	Navigate to BLOCKS_HOME and click ok
	Make sure that you DO NOT have the "Copy projects into workspace" checked.

    IMPORTANT: we had to compile our own version of driverlib
    to get the SysCtlClockGet to function properly, a but for our
    chip prevents the clock frequency from ever being reported as
    higher than a divisor of 3. To fix this, do:
    
    in file: driverlib/sysctl.c
    
    	comment out lines 2939 - 2942
    	//if(ui32Max < ui32Clk)
    	//{
    	//	ui32Clk = ui32Max;
    	//}
    
    Then, make sure that you clean and recompile all dependencies.
    Also ensure that your driverlib and usblib are in your workspace
    and you have them compiled as our code now links to them in the
    workspace copies.
